#Ludum Dare 31: Entire Game on One Screen

##Growth
####Objective:
Grow as large as possible.

####Instructions:
Click or touch to order your square to a location. You gain combo multipliers when you eat more than one green square per click and when your square bounces off an edge, so line up your shots for the best score.

####Notes:
Music does not work on OSX.

####Get it running:
Download the source files and unzip them (or clone into the repo).
You'll need to install the Kivy framework for your particular system.
